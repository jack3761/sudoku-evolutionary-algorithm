# Sudoku Evolutionary Algorithm

Evolutionary algorithm to solve a sudoku puzzle

## Installation

To begin, ensure numpy is installed with:

pip install numpy

Provided are 3 example grids, ensure these are placed within the same directory as the python script

## Getting started

This program is a coursework project to solve a solution with an evolutionary algorithm using different population sizes. There is no UI at this time, so to run the script should be opened and at the bottom there are some commented test cases. To run one of them, uncomment one and run the program.

To run an individual test, manually run with run() function where parameters can be changed.

It should be noted that some of the test cases can take a very long time to run (15-20 minutes) dependant on CPU.

In the evolve() function there are print functions, these are useful to see the generations for individual testing but for large amounts it can make it hard to read from the terminal so it is suggested that these are commented out when testing large amounts.
